# Click to Change Color of Website
This is a practice project to get the colors to change on a site when a specific button is clicked

All this changes is the background color of my three div sections nav bar, content area, and footer. It also changes the color: property to make the text the opposite of the background. This process could easily be replicated to introduce a "Light Mode" or "Dark Mode" configuration for any site.
